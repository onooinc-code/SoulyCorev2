# SoulyCore: Developer Tooling

**Document Version:** 2.0
**Status:** Current Implementation (Cognitive Architecture v2.0)

---

### 1. SoulyDev Center

The SoulyDev Center is an integrated, modal-based control panel for developers working on SoulyCore. It serves as a centralized hub for managing, documenting, and debugging the application's features and behavior directly within the running application.

*   **Access:** It can be opened from the main sidebar navigation.
*   **Purpose:** To provide developers with tools that enhance productivity and provide deep insight into the application's inner workings.
*   **Structure:** It uses a tabbed interface to switch between different tools.

### 2. Features Dictionary

The Features Dictionary is a live, interactive, and data-driven documentation system that serves as the single source of truth for the application's feature set.

*   **Functionality:** Provides a full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface for managing feature specifications.
*   **Data Model:** Each feature is an entry in the `features` table and contains fields for overview, status, UI/UX breakdown, logic flow, key files, and notes.
*   **Benefit:** This approach replaces static `README.md` files with a dynamic system, ensuring that feature documentation is always synchronized with the database.

### 3. Log Output Panel

The Log Output Panel is a real-time debugging tool integrated into the main chat interface, providing a chronological, filterable, and searchable stream of logs generated by both the frontend and backend.

*   **Data Source:** Logs are persisted in the `logs` table in the Vercel Postgres database and fetched via `/api/logs/all`.
*   **Benefit:** This provides an invaluable, persistent view of application events, crucial for debugging complex, asynchronous workflows.

### 4. Feature Health Dashboard & Test Case Registry

This new tab within the SoulyDev Center serves as the primary Quality Assurance hub for the project.

*   **Functionality:** It provides a comprehensive overview of the QA status of every feature registered in the Features Dictionary.
*   **Health Status:** For each feature, it displays a calculated health status ('Healthy', 'Failing', 'Untested', 'Partial') based on the outcomes of its associated test cases.
*   **Test Case Registry:** The dashboard is powered by the `feature_tests` database table. Developers can view, create, and manage detailed test cases linked to each feature.
*   **Manual Test Execution:** The UI allows developers to select a test case, view its manual steps and expected results, and then record the outcome ('Passed' or 'Failed') with a single click. This updates the test's status in the database and immediately reflects the change in the overall feature health.
*   **API Backend:** All operations are handled by the RESTful endpoints located at `/api/tests` and `/api/tests/[testId]`.
*   **Benefit:** This system formalizes the QA process, making it transparent, repeatable, and directly integrated into the development environment. It provides an at-a-glance view of the entire application's stability.
