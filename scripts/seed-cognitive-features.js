// This script's contents have been merged into `scripts/seed-features.js`.
// This was done to create a single, authoritative seed script that is run by `npm run db:seed`.
// Keeping two separate scripts caused the main seeding process to overwrite the new features added by this file.
// This file is now empty and can be safely deleted in the future.
