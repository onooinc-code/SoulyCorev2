# Task 6-2: Build Manual Test Execution UI

**Related Feature:** `V2 [UI] - Manual Test Execution UI`

---

### 1. Objective
To implement the UI within the health dashboard to allow developers to view test case details, manually execute them, and record the pass/fail results.

### 2. Scope of Work
- Within the `FeatureHealthDashboard.tsx` component, enhance the test case display.
- When a test case is selected, show its full details (description, manual steps, expected result).
- Add "Mark as Passed" and "Mark as Failed" buttons.
- Clicking these buttons will send a `PUT` request to the `/api/tests/[testId]` endpoint to update the test's status in the database.
- The UI should update to reflect the new status immediately.

### 3. Files to be Modified/Created
- `components/dev_center/FeatureHealthDashboard.tsx` (modified)

### 4. Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The user can view the detailed steps for a manual test case.
- [ ] The user can click a button to mark a test as passed.
- [ ] The user can click a button to mark a test as failed.
- [ ] The overall feature health status updates automatically when a test's status changes.
