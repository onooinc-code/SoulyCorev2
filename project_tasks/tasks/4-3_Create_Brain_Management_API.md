# Task 4-3: Create Brain Management API

**Related Feature:** `V2 [API] - Brain Management Endpoints`

---

### 1. Objective
To build a new set of CRUD API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting Brain configurations from the database.

### 2. Scope of Work
- Create new API route files under a new directory, e.g., `app/api/brains/route.ts` and `app/api/brains/[brainId]/route.ts`.
- Implement a `GET` handler in `route.ts` to fetch all Brains from the `brains` table.
- Implement a `POST` handler in `route.ts` to create a new Brain.
- Implement `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` handlers in `[brainId]/route.ts` to manage a specific Brain by its ID.
- All handlers will perform standard CRUD operations on the `brains` table in the database.

### 3. Files to be Modified/Created
- `app/api/brains/route.ts` (created)
- `app/api/brains/[brainId]/route.ts` (created)

### 4. Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A client can successfully create a new Brain via a `POST` request.
- [ ] A client can successfully retrieve all Brains via a `GET` request.
- [ ] A client can successfully update a specific Brain via a `PUT` request.
- [ ] A client can successfully delete a specific Brain via a `DELETE` request.
