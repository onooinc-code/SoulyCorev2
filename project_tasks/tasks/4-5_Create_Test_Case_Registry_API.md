**Related Feature:** `V2 [QA] - Test Case Registry Backend`

---

### 1. Objective
To build the CRUD API endpoints required to manage test cases in the `feature_tests` database table.

### 2. Scope of Work
- Create new API route files under a new directory, e.g., `app/api/tests/route.ts` and `app/api/tests/[testId]/route.ts`.
- Implement handlers for `GET` (all tests) and `POST` (new test).
- Implement handlers for `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` for a specific test ID.
- These endpoints will perform standard CRUD operations on the `feature_tests` table.

### 3. Files to be Modified/Created
- `app/api/tests/route.ts` (created)
- `app/api/tests/[testId]/route.ts` (created)

### 4. Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The UI can successfully create a new test case linked to a feature.
- [ ] The UI can successfully fetch all test cases.
- [ ] The UI can successfully update and delete individual test cases.
