- Dynamically load the content for the active tab.

### 3. Files to be Modified/Created

- [ ] Clicking the button opens the new `BrainCenter` modal.
- [ ] The modal contains a tab bar for navigating between different sections.
- [ ] The user can switch between the "Brain Management" and "Memory Viewer" tabs.
