### 1. Objective
To implement a UI for providing a direct, read-only view into the data of each memory module, with options for manual deletion or editing.

- Each item in the view will have "Edit" and "Delete" buttons for manual data management.

### 3. Files to be Modified/Created
- `components/brain_center/MemoryViewerTab.tsx` (created)

### 4. Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The user can select a memory module from a dropdown or sub-tab.
- [ ] The UI correctly fetches and displays data from the selected module's API endpoint.
- [ ] The data is presented in a clear, readable format.
- [ ] The user can successfully delete an individual memory entry.
