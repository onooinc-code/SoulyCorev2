### 1. Objective
To establish the new, empty directory structure for the Core Services Layer, providing a clean and organized foundation for all new backend logic.

### 2. Scope of Work

- Inside `core/`, create the following subdirectories:
  - `llm/`
  - `memory/`
  - `pipelines/`
  - `ingestion/`
- Add a `.gitkeep` file to each new directory to ensure they are committed to version control even while empty.

### 3. Files to be Modified/Created
- `core/.gitkeep`
- `core/llm/.gitkeep`
- `core/memory/.gitkeep`
- `core/pipelines/.gitkeep`
- `core/ingestion/.gitkeep`

### 4. Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The `core/` directory exists at the project root.
- [ ] The subdirectories `llm`, `memory`, `pipelines`, and `ingestion` exist inside `core/`.
- [ ] The new directory structure is successfully committed to the git repository.
