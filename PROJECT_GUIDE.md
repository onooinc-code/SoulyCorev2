## 1. Project Vision: The Total Recall Companion

**SoulyCore** is a next-generation, AI-powered assistant built for a single power user. Its foundational principle is a persistent, intelligent, and multi-faceted memory. It functions as a true **Total Recall Companion**, actively learning from every interaction to become an indispensable partner for managing complex information and executing sophisticated workflows through a secure, cloud-native, and highly configurable platform.

---

## 2. System Architecture

SoulyCore uses a modern, server-centric architecture where the frontend UI acts as a client to a powerful backend Core Engine. This ensures a clean separation of concerns and enhances security.

## 4. Project Structure Deep Dive

- **`/app`**: The core of the Next.js application.
  - **`/api`**: All backend API endpoints. These are lightweight wrappers that call the Core Engine.
- **`/components`**: All React UI components.
  - **`/providers`**: Global state management using React Context (`ConversationProvider`, `UIStateProvider`, etc.).
  - **`/dashboard`, `/agent_center`, `/brain_center`, etc.**: Components for the major UI hubs.
- **`/core`**: **The Cognitive Engine.** All decoupled, backend-only business logic resides here.
  - **`/agents`**: Contains the logic for the `AutonomousAgent`.
  - **`/llm`**: The LLM Provider Abstraction Layer, which decouples the application from any specific AI SDK.
  - **`/memory`**: All Single Memory Module (SMM) implementations (Episodic, Semantic, etc.).
  - **`/pipelines`**: The high-level orchestrators (`ContextAssemblyPipeline`, `MemoryExtractionPipeline`).
  - **`/tools`**: Implementations of agent-usable tools like `web_search`.
- **`/DocsV2`**: The individual, deep-dive chapters of this guide.
- **`/lib`**: Shared utilities, hooks, and global type definitions.
- **`/scripts`**: Standalone Node.js scripts for database management (`create-tables.js`, `seed-*.js`).
- **`PROJECT_GUIDE.md`**: This file. The single source of truth for all project documentation.

## 5. Feature Registry & Hubs Deep Dive

This section details all major user-facing hubs and their implemented features.

### 5.1. Dashboard Center (`/components/dashboard`)
The main landing page and high-level command center for the application.
- **Header Panel**: Displays the application's branding.
- **Hedra Goals Panel**: Manages and displays the project's strategic goals and subsystems.
- **Stats Panel**: Visualizes system-wide statistics with interactive charts powered by Nivo.
- **Documentation Panel**: Provides quick access to view and edit project documentation.
- **Actions, Decisions, Reports Panels**: Centralized locations for system-wide actions, user decisions, and generated reports.

### 5.2. Autonomous Agent Center (`/components/agent_center`)
A hub for defining high-level goals and launching autonomous agents to achieve them.
- **Goal Definition**: A UI for inputting complex, multi-step goals.
- **Plan Generation & Review**: The agent first generates a high-level plan, which the user must approve before execution.
- **Live Execution Report**: A real-time monitor showing the agent's thought process, actions, and observations for each step.
- **Run History**: A persistent list of all previous and ongoing agent runs.

### 5.3. Brain Center (`/components/brain_center`)
The central management hub for the AI's cognitive architecture.
- **Brain Management**: A full CRUD interface for creating and configuring different "Brains" (e.g., "Work Brain", "Personal Brain").
- **Memory Viewer**: An inspection tool to view the raw data within each memory module (Episodic, Semantic, Structured).

### 5.4. Memory Center (`/components/MemoryCenter.tsx`)
Manages the AI's **Structured Memory** (explicit facts).
- **Entity Management**: A full CRUD interface for managing entities (people, projects, concepts) stored in the Postgres database.
- **Relationship Graph**: A data viewer for entity relationships.
- **Segment Hub**: A UI to manage `Segments` (like Topics or Impact levels) for categorizing messages.

### 5.5. Contacts Hub (`/components/ContactsHub.tsx`)
A specialized part of Structured Memory for managing people and organizations.
- **Contact Management**: A full CRUD interface for contacts.
- **@Mention Integration**: Contacts can be mentioned in the chat input to provide specific context to the AI.

- **Workflow Builder**: A UI to create multi-step prompt chains where the output of one step can be the input for another.

### 5.7. Tools Hub (`/components/ToolsHub.tsx`)
The interface for managing **Procedural Memory** (the agent's capabilities).
- **Tool Registry**: A CRUD interface to define tools the agent can use.

## 6. Development Workflow & Rules

Adherence to these guidelines is **mandatory** for all development work. Refer to `DocsV2/09_Development_Workflow.md` for the full protocol.

1.  **Onboarding (Start of Session)**: Before any task, the agent **MUST** review this file (`PROJECT_GUIDE.md`) and key implementation files to understand the current project state.
2.  **Feature Management**: Features must be formally proposed, registered in the database, and approved before implementation.
3.  **Implementation & Versioning**: After coding, the feature status and project version must be updated in the database via the seed scripts (`scripts/seed-features.js`, `scripts/seed-version-history.js`).
4.  **Response Protocol**: Follow the Dual-Response protocol: an XML block with code changes, followed by a detailed HTML report.

## 7. Future Roadmap & Important Notes

### Key Unimplemented Features:
- **Advanced Autonomous Agent (ReAct)**: The current agent executes a pre-defined plan. The next major step is to implement a true ReAct (Reason + Act) loop where the agent can choose and use tools from the **Tools Hub** to solve problems dynamically.
- **Visual Relationship Graph**: The UI for the relationship graph is currently a JSON viewer and needs a visual component.

### Important Notes:
- The project is designed for a **single power user**. Features related to multi-tenancy or public sharing are out of scope.
- The project follows an **API-First** philosophy. All functionality should be exposed via a backend API, with the UI acting as a client.
- UI should remain consistent. Integrating large, external component libraries is strongly discouraged.
