### Bug #1: Lack of a Formal Bug Tracking System

**Error Details:**
The development process lacked a formal, persistent bug tracking system. This led to recurring errors and frustration for the user, as there was no historical record of past fixes to learn from or refer to.

**Solution:**
Implemented a new protocol requiring the creation and maintenance of this `BugTrack.md` file. As per the user's request, all future bug fixes will be logged here. The process involves:
1. Reviewing this file before starting a new fix.
2. Adding a horizontal rule (`---`) below the last entry.
3. Documenting the new error, the solution, and the files that were modified.
4. Confirming this process was followed in the response to the user.

**Modified Files:**
- `BugTrack.md` (This file)

**Changes Made:**
- Created the file and added this initial entry to formally establish the new bug tracking process.

### Bug #2: Incomplete Command Palette Feature

**Error Details:**
The `mod+k` keyboard shortcut is registered in `App.tsx` to toggle the `isCommandPaletteOpen` state, and `GlobalModals.tsx` is set up to render the `CommandPalette` component. However, the `components/CommandPalette.tsx` file itself is missing, making the feature non-functional. Additionally, the `lib/actionsRegistry.ts` file is missing several key actions available elsewhere in the UI.

**Solution:**
1.  **Expanded Action Registry:** Added missing actions (e.g., 'Open Command Palette', 'View Shortcuts', 'Add Knowledge') to `lib/actionsRegistry.ts` to provide a comprehensive list of commands.
2.  **Created Command Palette Component:** Created the `components/CommandPalette.tsx` file and implemented its full functionality. This includes:
    *   Fetching actions from the newly expanded registry.
    *   A search input to filter actions in real-time.
    *   Grouping actions by section for better organization.
    *   Full keyboard navigation (ArrowUp, ArrowDown, Enter, Escape).
    *   Mapping action `handlerId`s to context functions to execute them upon selection.
    *   Styling the component with the `glass-panel` theme to match the application's aesthetic.

**Modified Files:**
- `BugTrack.md`
- `lib/actionsRegistry.ts`
- `components/CommandPalette.tsx` (new file)
