# SoulyCore v2: Project Vision

**Document Version:** 2.0
**Status:** Live

---

### 1. Executive Summary

**SoulyCore** is a next-generation, AI-powered assistant built on the foundational principle of a persistent, intelligent, and multi-faceted memory. Evolved into its second-generation Cognitive Architecture, it now functions as a true **Total Recall Companion**. It actively learns from every interaction by leveraging a decoupled, modular Core Engine to manage its long-term memory and cognitive functions.

It is built for power users, developers, and small teams who require an AI partner that not only answers questions but also retains context, manages complex information, and proactively assists in sophisticated workflows through a secure, cloud-native, and highly configurable platform.

### 2. The Vision: A Total Recall Companion

The core vision of SoulyCore is to create a true AI partner that grows alongside its user. The v2 Cognitive Architecture directly addresses the "digital amnesia" of traditional AI assistants by externalizing memory into specialized, independently managed modules. This allows SoulyCore to maintain long-term context, synthesize new insights from disparate information, and become an indispensable hub for both personal and professional knowledge management.

### 3. Core Problem Solved: The "Long Context" Challenge

A fundamental limitation of LLMs is the finite size of their context windows. As conversations grow, older information is lost, breaking continuity.

**The v2 Architecture Solution:** Instead of relying on a linear context window, this architecture externalizes memory into specialized modules. A `Context Assembly Pipeline` intelligently retrieves only the most relevant pieces of information from these modules (Episodic, Semantic, Structured) and constructs a compact, optimized context for the LLM on every turn. This ensures that even in long-running conversations, the most pertinent information is always available to the AI.

### 4. Target User

SoulyCore is targeted at **power users, developers, and small teams**. The ideal user requires an AI assistant that goes beyond simple question-and-answer sessions and acts as a long-term knowledge partner.

Key features supporting this user profile include:
*   **Persistent Multi-Modal Memory:** The core value proposition, enabling long-term context retention for complex projects.
*   **The Brain Center:** A dedicated UI for managing the AI's cognitive functions, including its "Brains" and memory modules.
*   **Cognitive Inspector:** A tool that allows users to "look inside the AI's head" to see the context it used for a response and what it learned from the interaction.
*   **SoulyDev Center:** A comprehensive suite of integrated tools, including a live Feature Dictionary, a Feature Health Dashboard for QA, and an API Command Center for testing.
*   **Prompts Hub with Workflows:** Enables sophisticated users to create and execute powerful, multi-step, dynamic prompt chains.
