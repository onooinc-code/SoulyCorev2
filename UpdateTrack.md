### Update #1: Establishment of Formal Development Tracking System

**Details:**
Created a new, formalized system for tracking development progress and bug fixes to improve project clarity and maintainability. This involves two new markdown files.

**Modified Files:**
- `UpdateTrack.md` (new file)
- `ProjectDevelopInstructions.md` (new file)

**Changes Made:**
- **`UpdateTrack.md`**: This file was created to serve as a log for all new features, enhancements, and structural changes. It will be updated with every non-bug-fix modification.
- **`ProjectDevelopInstructions.md`**: This file was created to provide clear, persistent instructions on how to use both `BugTrack.md` and this `UpdateTrack.md` file, ensuring a consistent development process.

### Update #2: Implementation of Projects Hub

**Details:**
Implemented a new "Projects Hub" to replace the basic "Tasks Hub". This feature provides a more structured way to manage projects and their associated tasks. Each project can have a list of tasks, and users can trigger an AI-powered summarization of the project's status, which is displayed in a modal.

**Modified Files:**
- `UpdateTrack.md`
- `scripts/create-tables.js`
- `lib/types/data.ts`
- `app/api/projects/route.ts` (new file)
- `app/api/projects/[projectId]/route.ts` (new file)
- `app/api/projects/[projectId]/tasks/route.ts` (new file)
- `app/api/projects/[projectId]/summarize/route.ts` (new file)
- `components/ProjectsHub.tsx` (new file)
- `components/NavigationRail.tsx`
- `components/views/ActiveViewRenderer.tsx`
- `lib/actionsRegistry.ts`
- `components/Icons.tsx`
- `components/icons/ClipboardDocumentListIcon.tsx` (new file)
- `components/icons/TasksIcon.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
- **Backend**: Added `projects` and `project_tasks` tables to the database. Created a full suite of API endpoints for CRUD operations on projects and their tasks, plus an endpoint for AI summarization.
- **Frontend**: Created the `ProjectsHub.tsx` component to display and manage projects.
- **Integration**: Updated the `NavigationRail`, `ActiveViewRenderer`, and `actionsRegistry` to integrate the new hub into the application, replacing the old Tasks Hub link.
- **Icons**: Added a new `ClipboardDocumentListIcon` for the Projects Hub and updated the old `TasksIcon` to avoid visual duplication.
