# Feature & Update Tracking Log

This file documents all new features, enhancements, and significant modifications to the project. It serves as a chronological record of development progress. Before making any new feature change, this file must be read, and a new entry must be added below the last horizontal rule.

### Update #1: Establishment of Formal Development Tracking System

**Details:**
Created a new, formalized system for tracking development progress and bug fixes to improve project clarity and maintainability. This involves two new markdown files.

**Modified Files:**
- `UpdateTrack.md` (new file)
- `ProjectDevelopInstructions.md` (new file)

**Changes Made:**
- **`UpdateTrack.md`**: This file was created to serve as a log for all new features, enhancements, and structural changes. It will be updated with every non-bug-fix modification.
- **`ProjectDevelopInstructions.md`**: This file was created to provide clear, persistent instructions on how to use both `BugTrack.md` and this `UpdateTrack.md` file, ensuring a consistent development process.

### Update #2: Implementation of Projects Hub

**Details:**
Implemented a new "Projects Hub" to replace the basic "Tasks Hub". This feature provides a more structured way to manage projects and their associated tasks. Each project can have a list of tasks, and users can trigger an AI-powered summarization of the project's status, which is displayed in a modal.

**Modified Files:**
- `UpdateTrack.md`
- `scripts/create-tables.js`
- `lib/types/data.ts`
- `app/api/projects/route.ts` (new file)
- `app/api/projects/[projectId]/route.ts` (new file)
- `app/api/projects/[projectId]/tasks/route.ts` (new file)
- `app/api/projects/[projectId]/summarize/route.ts` (new file)
- `components/ProjectsHub.tsx` (new file)
- `components/NavigationRail.tsx`
- `components/views/ActiveViewRenderer.tsx`
- `lib/actionsRegistry.ts`
- `components/Icons.tsx`
- `components/icons/ClipboardDocumentListIcon.tsx` (new file)
- `components/icons/TasksIcon.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
- **Backend**: Added `projects` and `project_tasks` tables to the database. Created a full suite of API endpoints for CRUD operations on projects and their tasks, plus an endpoint for AI summarization.
- **Frontend**: Created the `ProjectsHub.tsx` component to display and manage projects.
- **Integration**: Updated the `NavigationRail`, `ActiveViewRenderer`, and `actionsRegistry` to integrate the new hub into the application, replacing the old Tasks Hub link.
- **Icons**: Added a new `ClipboardDocumentListIcon` for the Projects Hub and updated the old `TasksIcon` to avoid visual duplication.

### Update #3: Implementation of Experiences Hub

**Details:**
Implemented the "Experiences Hub" to fix a missing component error and provide a UI for managing learned agent workflows. An "experience" is a generalized, reusable plan created by the AI after a successful autonomous agent run. This hub allows the user to view these learned experiences, their trigger keywords, and their abstract plans.

**Modified Files:**
- `UpdateTrack.md`
- `components/hubs/ExperiencesHub.tsx` (new file)
- `app/api/experiences/route.ts` (new file)
- `app/api/experiences/[experienceId]/route.ts` (new file)

**Changes Made:**
- **Backend**: Created new API endpoints (`/api/experiences` and `/api/experiences/[experienceId]`) to fetch and delete learned experiences from the database.
- **Frontend**: Created the `ExperiencesHub.tsx` component, which displays a list of learned experiences in a card format. Each card shows the goal template, trigger keywords, and the abstract plan. It also includes functionality to delete an experience.
- **Integration**: This component was already referenced in `ActiveViewRenderer.tsx`, resolving a runtime error by its creation.
---

### Update #4: Implement Communication Hub Backend & Frontend

**Details:**
Implemented the backend and frontend functionality for the Communication Hub. This replaces the mock data in the "Channel Dashboard" with live data from the `comm_channels` database table. Users can now create persistent webhook channels, and the "Send Broadcast" feature now logs events to the database instead of being a simulation.

**Modified Files:**
- `UpdateTrack.md`
- `app/api/comm/channels/route.ts` (new file)
- `components/hubs/CommunicationHub.tsx` (new file)
- `components/hubs/comm_hub/ChannelDashboard.tsx` (new file)
- `components/hubs/comm_hub/WebhookCreator.tsx` (new file)
- `components/hubs/comm_hub/BroadcastManager.tsx` (new file)

**Changes Made:**
- **API `channels`**: Created `GET` and `POST` endpoints to manage channels in the database.
- **Components**: Created a suite of new components to form the hub's UI: `CommunicationHub` for the main view, `ChannelDashboard` to display channels, `WebhookCreator` for adding new channels, and `BroadcastManager` for sending messages. The components are fully wired to the backend APIs and include state management, user feedback, and notifications.
- **Integration**: The `CommunicationHub` is now a fully functional view accessible from the main navigation.

### Update #5: Implement Webhook Notification Sending

**Details:**
Implemented the feature to send notifications to a selected webhook channel. This enhances the Communication Hub by making the created webhooks functional. The `BroadcastManager` UI has been updated to include a channel selector, and a new API endpoint (`/api/comm/notify/[channelId]`) has been created to handle the outgoing POST request to the target webhook URL.

**Modified Files:**
- `UpdateTrack.md`
- `app/api/comm/notify/[channelId]/route.ts` (new file)
- `components/hubs/comm_hub/BroadcastManager.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
- **API `notify`**: Created a new dynamic API route that accepts a `channelId` and a message payload. It fetches the channel's configuration, constructs a POST request, and sends the notification to the external webhook URL. It also logs the outcome of the send attempt.
- **`BroadcastManager.tsx`**: Refactored the component to fetch and display a dropdown of available webhook channels. Users can now select a target channel for their message. The component's name is now slightly misleading, as it handles both broadcasts and targeted notifications, but is kept for consistency. The "Send" logic now calls the new `/api/comm/notify/[channelId]` endpoint.

### Update #6: Add Webhook URL Configuration

**Details:**
Enhanced the Communication Hub by allowing users to specify a destination URL when creating a new webhook channel. This makes the "Send Notification" feature fully functional, as it now has an endpoint to send data to.

**Modified Files:**
- `UpdateTrack.md`
- `app/api/comm/channels/route.ts`
- `components/hubs/comm_hub/WebhookCreator.tsx`
- `components/hubs/comm_hub/ChannelDashboard.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
- **`WebhookCreator.tsx`**: Added a "Webhook URL" input field that appears when the channel type is 'webhook'.
- **`app/api/comm/channels/route.ts`**: The POST endpoint now accepts a `config` object in the request body and saves it to the `config_json` field in the database.
- **`ChannelDashboard.tsx`**: The `ChannelCard` component now displays the configured URL for webhook channels, providing better visibility.
- **`UpdateTrack.md`**: Added this entry to document the update.
