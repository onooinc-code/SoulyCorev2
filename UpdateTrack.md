### Update #22: Experience Linkage & Cognitive Analytics

**Details:**
Enhanced the Cognitive Core by bridging the gap between stored experiences and real-time conversation. Introduced a visual analytics suite for Brain data management.

**Changes Made:**
- **Experience Linkage:** `ContextAssemblyPipeline` now proactively matches current user queries against `Experiences` (learned task patterns) and provides them as 'How-To' context to Gemini.
- **Brain Visualizer:** Added a new "Brain Analytics" tab to the Brain Center, featuring Nivo pie and bar charts to visualize knowledge density and distribution across different memory brains.
- **Agent Mode Shortcut:** Added a dedicated "Agent Trigger" button in the `ChatFooter` for instant transition to autonomous operation.
- **API Expansion:** Implemented `/api/brains/stats` to aggregate entity and relationship metrics.
